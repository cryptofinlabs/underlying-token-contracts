Etherscan doesn't have their contract. This is from their [GitHub](https://github.com/icon-foundation/ico).

I resolved imports with the code included in their library.

I tried adding it to Etherscan but my submission was rejected.

I don't know which compiler version was used, and whether it was optimized. Additionally, they may have used a different version of the code.
